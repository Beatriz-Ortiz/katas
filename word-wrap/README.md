# Word wrap

Given a string and a maximum column length add a line break to the string the necessary times in order for the string to not exceed the column length.

## Extra

It should try not to break the word in the middle, but leave some blank spaces until the specified limit. If it can't do that then it should break the word and add a "-" on the word before the line break.
