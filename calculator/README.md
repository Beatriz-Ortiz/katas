# Calculator

Create a calculator that can handle sum and subtraction operations. This calculator will receive a string and returns the result. For example:

- "1 + 1" = 2
- "1 - 1" = 0
- "4 + 2 + 1 + 3" = 11
- "4 - 2 + 1" = 3

Handle division and multiplications, taking into account the precedence of operations.

- "3 \* 3" = 9
- "1 + 3 \* 3" = 10
- "3 \ 3" = 1
- "1 + 3 / 3" = 2
